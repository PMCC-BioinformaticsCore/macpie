This folder documents the origin of all CSV files stored in inst/extdata/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Description of files
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The files in inst/extdata/ (e.g.PMMSq033_CTG_cellcount.csv and PMMSq033_metadata.csv)
contain experimental design metadata for 384-well plates used in sequencing assays.

Each file specifies, for every well in the plate:
- Well ID (A01–P24 for 384-well format)
- Experimental treatment (compound, vehicle, or control)
- Barcode / index information for linking wells to sequencing output
Any other extra information for each well can be:
- Cell type or cell line
- Concentration of treatment
- Time point
- Any phenotypic data if available 

For each row in the file, it should at least contains:
- Well ID 
- Barcode / index
- Experimental treatment

The other file (mouse_human_genes.csv.gz) is the file to provide gene_id conversion
between human and mouse. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How the files were generated
---------------------------------------------------------------------
These metadata sheets were created directly by the experimenters prior to running
the assays. Typically, they can be assembled manually in Excel or a similar
spreadsheet program, using the laboratory’s plate layout and barcoding scheme.

No processing, transformation, or computational pipeline was applied to generate
these CSV files. They represent the "as-designed" experimental plan.

Mouse human gene conversion file can be generated by running the script of
convert_human_to_mouse_ids.R in the R/.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Reproducibility
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To recreate equivalent metadata files:
- Open a new spreadsheet (e.g. in Excel).
- Create a column "Well_ID" with entries A01–P24.
- Add columns "Barcode", "Compound", "Concentration", "CellType", etc.
  Fill in with the experimental design planned for each well.
- Save the sheet as UTF-8 CSV.

Thus, any user can produce their own metadata sheets by following this format.

To regenerate mouse human gene conversion file, you can run the 
convert_human_to_mouse command after loading our package.

4. Source and Licensing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Source: Created by the submitting laboratory as part of assay planning.
License: These metadata contain no proprietary or patient-identifying
information and are released under the same license as the package.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- No scripts are needed for metadata regeneration; the files are provided
  exactly as designed by researchers.
- Downstream package functions use these files to link experimental
  design information with sequencing data.
